Description: Userspace interface to radeon-specific kernel DRM services -- runtime
 This library implements the userspace interface to the radeon-specific kernel
 DRM services.  DRM stands for "Direct Rendering Manager", which is the

 currently used on Linux to provide hardware-accelerated OpenGL drivers.
